## What is DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)?

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor purchases a target asset using a fixed amount of money at regular intervals.

_Example: Every first sunday of the month, Bob buys the equivalent of $100 of BTC, regardless of its price._

### Pros

While DCA may be suboptimal for a rational investor that aims at buying low and selling high while trying to time the market, it offers a set of rationales for its use:

- **Simplicity:** DCA can be implemented by any investor, no matter its level of experience or knowledge.
- **Accessibility:** Small investors using DCA for the long term accumulation of an asset do not need to expose big amounts of capital all at once, they can instead pour into the strategy small quantities at their preferred pace (e.g. their monthly salary savings)
- **Peace of Mind:** No more trying to time the market. DCA reduce investor's sense of responsibility for a choice, which reduces the emotional involvement (anxiety caused by either regret for bad outcomes or joy for good outcomes caused by the short term volatility).

### Cons

On the other hand, DCA also has its drawbacks:

- **Markets tend to go up:** On the long term the market tends to go up. While lump sums may suffer from bad timing in the short term (e.g. buying the top at the end of a bull market), on the long term they will provide a better return than DCA, which averaged the price over the overall uptrend.
- **Investor must still choose wisely:** DCA removes the "time the market" responsibility for the investor, but it doesn't assolve him from choosing a good investment. At the end of the day, there will be a positive return only if the final asset price is above the average buy price. It is vital that the asset in question is a good one that increases its value over time.
- **It doesn't account for world's information:** Knowledge of what's happening in the world at a specific time in history provides the investors with information that can help decision making. E.g. recognized market crashes or bear market periods represent a better time to enter the market when compared to periods where the asset reaches his ATH.

## Can we improve DCA?

If there were a proven method to "time the market", or a way to go back in time, buy and HODL we wouldn't be here talking about DCA.

Since it is not the case, DCA is what we have to confidently enter the market at any time regardless of the current situation. Now the question is: **can we use available world information to consistently improve our investment performance over time?**
