Thoughs, questions and optimization experiments on the DCA investment strategy.

## What is DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)?

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor purchases a target asset using a fixed amount of money at regular intervals.

While DCA may be suboptimal for a rational investor that aims at buying low and selling high while trying to time the market, it offers a set of rationales for its use:

- **Simplicity:** DCA can be implemented by any investor regardless of its experience or knowledge.
- **Accessibility:** Small investors using DCA for the long term accumulation of an asset do not need to expose big amounts of capital all at once, they can instead pour into the strategy small quantities at their preferred pace (e.g. their monthly salary savings)
- **Peace of Mind:** No more trying to time the market. DCA reduce investor's sense of responsibility for a choice, which reduces the emotional involvement (anxiety caused by either regret for bad outcomes or joy for good outcomes caused by the short term volatility).

On the other hand, DCA also presents drawbacks:

- **Markets tend to go up:** On the long term the market tends to go up. While lump sums may suffer from bad timing in the short term (e.g. buying the top at the end of a bull market), on the long term they will provide a better return than DCA, which averaged the price over the overall uptrend.
- **Investor must still choose wisely:** DCA removes the "time the market" responsibility for the investor, but it doesn't assolve him from choosing a good investment. At the end of the day, there will be a positive return only if the final asset price is above the average buy price. It is vital that the asset in question is a good one that increases its value over time.
