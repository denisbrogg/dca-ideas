Thoughs, questions and optimization experiments on the DCA investment strategy.

## What is DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)?

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor purchases a target asset using a fixed amount of money at regular intervals.

While DCA may be suboptimal for a rational investor that aims at buying low and selling high while trying to time the market, it offers a set of rationales for its use:

- **Simplicity**: DCA can be implemented by any investor regardless of its experience or knowledge.
- **Accessibility**: Small investors using DCA for the long term accumulation of an asset do not need to expose big amounts of capital all at once, they can instead pour into the strategy small quantities at their preferred pace (e.g. their monthly salary savings)
- **Peace of Mind**: DCA reduce investor's sense of responsibility for a choice, which reduces the emotional involvement (anxiety caused by either regret for bad outcomes or joy for good outcomes caused by the short term volatility).
